New options to network added by Jeremy Kozdon:

run_network usage:
   run_network [-b] [-d] [-c] [-m] [-s] [-f] [-o outprefix] [-g groupfile] [-t tol] [-r rtol] [-a atol] [-z iteration number] netfile sample_time n_sample
   run_network [-b] [-d] [-c] [-m] [-s] [-f] [-o outprefix] [-g groupfile] [-t tol] [-r rtol] [-a atol] [-z iteration number] netfile t1 t2 ... tn

- '-b' option tells network to use GMRES instead of the default direct LU
  factorization with partial pivoting
- '-d' option tells network to pass the Jacobian in the LU factorization case
  and the Jacobian-vecotor multiply in the GMRES case to CVODE instead of CVODE
  using its default finite-difference Jacobian
- '-z ITERATION_NUMBER' tells network to output a plain text file called
  outprefix.m. The file is a MATLAB script file which can be read into MATLAB
  (assuming it is in MATLAB current working directory) with the command
  outprefix. The header of the file also contains some basic MATLAB commands to
  operate on the matrix. (outprefix in the above is the outprefix specified by
  the user when they ran run_network.)
