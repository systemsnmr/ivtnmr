## Watch out:
===================
# - TOPSPIN 4 - qumulti over a running queue is likely to skip the first experiment added with QUMULTI !!!!

## Quick procedure outline:
===================
- create expt by copying temp calibration with edc
- temperature calibration ~5' (lock, shim, run) (at least once a week)
- insert sample
- setup using: edpy in_v03*
- in the notes.txt file -- search for " XX" - follow placeholders (action points) in the script:
   - create experiment series using: edpy createExpSeries.py
   - after adding T7 & putting sample into magnet - run "in_start_XX" script
   - start series: qumulti ..

- consider sometimes checking 1H, 31P atmm (tune/match) at the end of FULL series (in case if strongly detuned - pulses are not exactly 90-degree anymore - quantification may be off).

## Notes
===================
Since ATMM is NOT SO STABLE (may detune over time), do either:
  - check MANUALLY STABILITY OF ATMM after some minutes (if used EXACT optimization in the in_v0* script).
  - do manual atmm first - wait until stable - use UNEXACT_TUNE_MATCH flag in the in_v0* script.

- Post-series (if adding something after delay): always add an extra zg-sofast experiment at the beginning (expno 321) - to get fast events - if there are any!
- Set post-series from expno 322 (normally 23-300 is the first - "CO"-transcriptional batch.)
- To ease automated sorting later - record any non-standard experiments with expnos
  ABOVE 500! (sorting script will take 12-500 by default)

- Consider replacing zg-wg with zgesgp?! (better baseline, and we likely anyway don't care about high-Mw species in this spectrum!)



## Experiments recorded in the reference set
============================================
12 zg-wg (to get individual NTPs in future)
13 stocsy (not used much)
14 1D31P
15 2DHN (SFHMQC default)
16 zg-sofast

! If NTP signals give too much t1-noise - can include hsqcetgpsi_02.yn instead of SFHMQC - gradients filtering out this noise (but expt is less sensitive than sfhmqc).

## Before CREATING series of repeating expts
======================================
## Check 31P pulse
If you used INCLUDE_PAROPT:
- 31P pulse is OK? XX (45.5-46us):
re 4 999
Do not need to perfectionize here. Because we are using internal referencing for quantification, if pulses are slightly off - does not affect quantification.


## Check stability of tuning-matching for 1H and 31P
This is especially important if you changed the buffer / tube type / etc - there is more tuning needed, the tuning mechanical rods are adjusted more, and the likelihood of detuning is higher.
1H:
re 3 100; .md no_load; rep 101; rep 102; rep 103
31P:
re 4 100; .md no_load; rep 101; rep 102; rep 103

1H - OK? XX
31P - OK? XX

If want save the current tune-match state - start atmm and save into new procno:
re 3; atmm;
wbwr <PROCNO>

If detuned too much - re-tune, and potentially recalibrate 1H pulse, and set the correct 1H pulse into all experiments.


## Create the series
======================================
 XX
edpy createExpSeries.py



## START the series
======================================

## Timezone offset required below. In CH have: +0100 (winter), +0200 (summer)
Added polymerase at <time0>XXXX-XX-XX XX:XX:XX +0200</time0>
- Run the latest version of starting script (script requires time0 above to be set already).
 XX
edpy in_start*

(Script does: lock, tune-match 1H and 31P, shim twice).

 XX
- Qumulti 22-300 > zg > press start
- Be careful - if doing zg on exnpo 22, and then qumulti 23-300 - in TOPSPIN 4 - qumulti over a running queue is likely to skip the first experiment added with QUMULTI !!!! (i.e. in this case 23 will be skipped).

## Post-series (if doing any):
==============================

- Adding protein (or buffer, for proper control of dilution effect):
- XX (Normally used 45ul to not have more than 10% dilution)
- Added after XX hours [13 hours]

## Add experiments (if did not add them before):
- see flag_post_series_addon in:
 XX
edpy createExpSeries.py

- Add/Start with 321 - zg-sofast - to check for fast events!

Time of addition:
<time1>XXXX-XX-XX XX:XX:XX +0200</time1>

After inserting the sample:
-  XX: lock, atmm check, topshim twice
-  XX: Start from 321 ..
