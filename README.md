### In Vitro Transcription NMR (IVTNMR). Collection of code related to the co-transcriptional RNA folding network reconstruction.

#### Code
- ./aborts_design - generates 5'-overhang sequences based on specific criteria, test/remove those which form dimers and those which might interfere with the folding of the main RNA by base-pairing with it.
